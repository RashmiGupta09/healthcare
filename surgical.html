    <p>Aesthetic plastic surgery (also called cosmetic surgery) refers to procedures that improve the appearance of the face and body. They include tummy tuck (abdominoplasty), breast augmentation, breast reduction, eyelid surgery, nose reshaping (rhinoplasty), face lift and removal of fat (liposuction).

        Plastic surgery is a broad field that encompasses both cosmetic (aesthetic) procedures and reconstructive procedures. Reconstructive surgery focuses on repairing or reconstructing problems caused by congenital deformities, tumor removals such as cancer, trauma or other reasons.<br>Some other lesser-known plastic surgery procedures include carpal tunnel surgery, microsurgery, rhinoplasty and peripheral nerve surgery.​​</p><br>

<h3>
    What is cosmetic surgery?
</h3>
     <p>
        Cosmetic or aesthetic surgery is what most people think about when they hear the term plastic surgery, and those are procedures done to improve a person’s appearance to help their self-esteem. These are elective procedures, patients are usually healthy before they have the surgery, and insurance does not cover these procedures. <br>

Patients will be attracted to the idea of leaving the country to have a medical procedure because it is much less expensive. I see patients who have had procedures overseas and come to me after experiencing a poor result.
<br> There are a few things to consider before you opt for a procedure overseas. Do you know whether that surgeon is well-trained? How safe is the surgery center? And how easy will it be for you to go back to that doctor if you experience complications? 
<br>An overseas experience makes the relationship with the physician much more challenging.
