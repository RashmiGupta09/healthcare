<h1>What is dental care?</h1>
<p>A healthy mouth, free of infections, injuries and other problems with teeth and gums, is important in maintaining your overall health.Disease and other conditions can affect your dental health and dental problems can affect other parts of your body. Failing to properly care for your oral health may lead to other health problems. Injuries to the mouth and teeth can cause problems, especially for young people playing sports. Make sure young (and not so young) athletes use a properly fitted mouth guard, especially when playing contact sports or engaging is activities where falls and blows to the mouth are possible.</p>

  <br>
    <p>Dental health begins shortly after birth and continues the rest of your life. Constant and consistent oral health habits come from habits and patterns established as children under the direction of a parent.

        Good oral health practices and regular visits to dental health professionals will help you enjoy the benefits of a bright smile and a pain-free mouth.
        
        If you begin good oral health practices at an early age and stick with them through adulthood, the odds are good that you will have a healthy mouth, pleasant breath, strong teeth and a bright smile.
        
        Even if you have let dental problems develop over time, it is never too late to see a dental health professional for corrective procedures. Thanks to modern practices, much of the pain some people fear is gone from dental health procedures.​​</p><br>

<h3>
    Why dental care is important
</h3>
     <p>
        Cavities are painful places on your teeth where decay has eaten through the enamel and exposed a tooth's root. Hot or cold food or liquids can send a painful signal that something is wrong. <br>
Cavities may not have any symptoms until after significant damage to the tooth. This is why regular visits to your dental professional are so important. 
<br>Early signs of tooth decay are easier to treat than advanced cases.<br>
Thanks to modern dental technology, treating tooth decay, especially in the early stages, is often only mildly uncomfortable, at its worse. Medications that numb the area of the decay eliminate the pain of filling a cavity for most people.
