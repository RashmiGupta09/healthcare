<h1> Eye care tips </h1>
<p>Protect your eyes – Sunglasses with 100% UV protection safeguard your eyes from the sun’s potentially harmful ultraviolet radiation. When needed, protective eyewear offers a different type of protection — a physical barrier between your eyes and damaging objects.</p>
<div>
    <p>Stay active – Exercising and moving around throughout the day can benefit your eyes and the rest of your body too. Research continues to show a possible relationship between exercise and a lower risk of developing eye conditions, such as cataracts, glaucoma and macular degeneration.
        <br><br>

        Eat plenty of healthy, whole foods – Proper nutrition is a big part of at-home eye care. Consuming plenty of nutrients — including omega-3s, bioflavonoids, and vitamins A, C, D and E — can reduce the risk of eye disease and keep your vision sharp.
         <br> <br>  
        Quit smoking – Smoking can damage your eyes in more ways than one. Not only are smokers twice as likely to suffer from dry eyes, they’re more at risk for sight-threatening conditions like cataracts, macular degeneration, uveitis and retinopathy.
        <br><br>
        Care for your contacts – Misusing contact lenses can lead to side effects and serious infections. If you wear contacts, follow any care guidelines provided by your lens manufacturer to limit the risk of experiencing unwelcome effects.​​</p><br>

    Eye care for kids
</h3>
     <p>
        Eye care is just as important for children as it is for any other age group. In some ways, it’s even more important.

A child’s eyes develop quickly as they grow, so it’s important to diagnose any eye-related conditions early in life. Treatment is often easier, with a higher chance of success, when a doctor catches a problem before it has a chance to fully develop or progress.<br>

The progression of myopia (nearsightedness) is a growing concern for parents around the world. If a child’s myopia turns into high myopia later in life, their risk of developing serious eye disease can go up exponentially.

However, myopia’s progression can often be slowed with early lifestyle changes and treatment, reducing the probability of high myopia in the future.<br>

In school, about 80% of everything a child learns is absorbed visually. There are three kinds of vision problems that can affect a child’s learning:

<br> <br>Eye health and refractive errors – Common conditions such as nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism can all impact the way a child learns. An eye doctor should be able to prescribe corrective lenses and other forms of treatment to help your child see clearly.<br>

Functional eye problems – An issue with the way the eyes align, or how they work together. These include conditions like strabismus (a misalignment of the eyes) and amblyopia (lazy eye) and can affect many other areas of a child’s daily life.<br>

Problems with vision perception – Any vision-related condition that affects the way a child interprets or stores the information they see.
